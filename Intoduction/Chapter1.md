 "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

Authored by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, this book was published in 1994.
The book introduces 23 classic design patterns, which are proven solutions to common software design problems. These patterns are categorized into three types: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral, each addressing different aspects of object-oriented design.

### Types of Design pattern

1. Creational Patterns.
2. Structural Patterns.
3. Behavioral Patterns.

| **Category**          | **Design Patterns**                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Creational Patterns** | - Abstract Factory  <br> - Builder <br> - Factory Method <br> - Prototype <br> - Singleton |
| **Structural Patterns** | - Adapter <br> - Bridge <br> - Composite <br> - Decorator <br> - Facade <br> - Flyweight <br> - Proxy |
| **Behavioral Patterns** | - Chain of Responsibility <br> - Command <br> - Interpreter <br> - Iterator <br> - Mediator <br> - Memento <br> - Observer <br> - State <br> - Strategy <br> - Template Method <br> - Visitor |


### Is there any other type of design patterns other then oop design pattern ?

Yes, there are several other types of design patterns beyond Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) design patterns. These patterns are applicable in various programming paradigms and domains. Here are some examples:

1. Functional Design Patterns
2. Concurrency Patterns
3. Architectural Patterns
4. Behavioral Patterns (Non-OOP)
5. Data Patterns
6. Enterprise Integration Patterns
7. Security Patterns
8. User Interface Patterns

|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Functional Design Patterns** | - Higher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them.<br> - Currying: Breaking down a function that takes multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take a single argument.<br> - Memoization: Caching the results of expensive function calls to optimize performance. |
| **Concurrency Patterns**       | - Producer-Consumer: A pattern where one or more producers generate data that one or more consumers process.<br> - Future/Promise: A pattern for handling asynchronous operations that may return a result in the future.<br> - Observer: Manages asynchronous event streams, often in reactive programming. |
| **Architectural Patterns**     | - MVC (Model-View-Controller): Separates the application into three interconnected components.<br> - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): Separates the UI from business logic, often used in UI frameworks.<br> - Microservices: Structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. |
| **Behavioral Patterns (Non-OOP)** | - Pipeline: A series of processing stages where the output of one stage is the input to the next.<br> - Event Sourcing: Logs state changes as a series of events rather than overwriting the state. |
| **Data Patterns**              | - Data Access Object (DAO): Provides an abstract interface to a database or other persistence mechanism.<br> - Repository: Mediates between the domain and data mapping layers. |
| **Enterprise Integration Patterns** | - Message Broker: Handles message distribution, routing, and transformation in a distributed system.<br> - Event-Driven Architecture: Determines program execution flow based on events. |
| **Security Patterns**          | - Singleton: Ensures only one instance of a security-related object exists.<br> - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restricts system access to authorized users based on their role. |
| **User Interface Patterns**    | - Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates input logic, business logic, and interface in UI.<br> - Mediator: Manages communication between different UI components to decouple them. |
